### This is the code for the algorithm proposed in the paper "Fuzzy Clustering-based Adaptive Regression for Drifting Data Streams"
### Please cite as "Y. Song, J. Lu, H. Lu and G. Zhang, "Fuzzy Clustering-based Adaptive Regression for Drifting Data Streams," in IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems.doi: 10.1109/TFUZZ.2019.2910714"

### This is FUZZ-CARE first initial
### It is a testing edition, we are working on improving it. Any questiong please contact the author via yiliao.song@student.uts.edu.au
### Deep learning toolbox and fuzz logic toolbox are needed for this code
### Run the main.m file to directly get prediction result for real-world data streams
### Results may a bit different from the reported accuracy in the paper, as intialization of fuzzy c-means is based on a random process.
